In this program:

We input our location in the where.data and where.js and then we run the geoload.ipynb file so that where.data can be updated and geodata.sqlite is created. Once this is done a data base is created.

With the help of geodump.ipynb we read the database and we update where.js.

To verify whether the loaction we enetered has been stored or not we open where.html and we can check in the google maps.

I have added the screenshots for better understanding.
